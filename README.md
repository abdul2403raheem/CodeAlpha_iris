CodeAlpha_Iris

📌 Project Overview
This project, developed as part of my internship at CodeAlpha, focuses on the classification of iris flowers into three distinct species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The analysis is performed using a range of machine learning models on a dataset containing flower measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

⚙️ Tech Stack
This project leverages the following libraries for data processing, analysis, and model building:

1.Python
2.Pandas, NumPy
3.Matplotlib, Seaborn
4.Scikit-learn

🚀 Features
The Iris_Analysis.ipynb notebook demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:

1.Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
2.training and evaluation of multiple classification models:
3.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4.Logistic Regression
5.Decision Tree Classifier
6.Support Vector Machine (SVM)
7.Evaluation using standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
8.Visualization of model performance through confusion matrices for each model.

📊 Results

All four machine learning models successfully achieved

100% accuracy on the test dataset. The confusion matrices further confirm that all flower samples were correctly classified by each model, indicating robust performance.
